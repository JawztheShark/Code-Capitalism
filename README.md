narration:

<yes> <no>
clicking yes opens up the next narrative element, click no takes you to the my little pony fan wiki

> This is a game about coding, it's not going to actually teach you to code

you click the button, it adds lines of code, when you have 4 lines, a run button appears
And you run and complete the hello world project
the next project takes 10 lines, but as you're coding there's some bugs you don't find out about until you click the run button, and the <fix bugs> button appears.
the next project you get a linter, and some of the bugs become visible as you make them
